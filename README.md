# Microrealestate

Microrealestate is a set of microservices which work together to offer an open source application for property management.

This application draws its fundamentals from a monolithic application: [Loca](https://github.com/camelaissani/loca)

The first objective is to combine the monolith application and the microservices to provide new functionalities.

In a second stage, the monolith application will be broken in microservices.

## Getting started

### Prerequisite
- Docker and docker-compose installed

### Clone the GitHub repository
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate.git
```

### Start the application
```shell
$ ./mre start
```
> Startup takes time as a few docker images are built.

> `mre` is a bash script. It doesn't work on windows.
