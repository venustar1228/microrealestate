# Microrealestate

Microrealestate is a set of microservices which work together to offer an open source application for property management.

This application draws its fundamentals from a monolithic application: [Loca](https://github.com/camelaissani/loca)

The first objective is to combine the monolith application and the microservices to provide new functionalities.

In a second stage, the monolith application will be broken in microservices.

## Getting started

### Prerequisite
- Docker and docker-compose installed

> The `mre` bash script is uses for building, running the application.
> It doesn't work on windows.

### Clone the GitHub repository
```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate.git
```

### Build the application
```shell
$ ./mre build
```

### Start the application
```shell
$ ./mre start
```

At the end, it displays the application links:

```shell
Front-end             http://localhost:8080
kibana                http://localhost:9000
cadvisor              http://localhost:9100
rabbitmq Management   http://localhost:8100
```

### Start the application in development mode

```shell
$ ./mre dev
```

### Debugging the application

You would need to have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.

Then bring up the Debug view, click on the Debug icon in the **Activity Bar** on the side of VS Code. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+D`.

![Activity Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/debugging/debugicon.png)

In a terminal launch the application in development mode:

```shell
$ ./mre dev
```

Next, go to the debug bar:

![Activity Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/debugging/launch-configuration.png)

Then select one of these values to attach the VS Code debugger to the application:

- `Docker: Attach to Loca` (The web application)
- `Docker: Attach to Emailer` (Generates and sends emails)
- `Docker: Attach to PdfGenerator` (Generates PDF documents)
