# Microrealestate

Microrealestate is a set of microservices which work together to offer an open source application for property management.

This application draws its fundamentals from a monolithic application: [Loca](https://github.com/camelaissani/loca)

The first objective is to combine the monolith application and the microservices to provide new functionalities.
